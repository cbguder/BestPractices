## Practices and Principles

Some of the practices and principles I tried to demonstrate in this sample project are:

* [Test-driven development][tdd] using [Cedar][]
* [Dependency injection][di] using [Blindside][]
* Promise-based async APIs using [KSDeferred][]
* [Single responsibility principle][srp]
* [Composition over inheritance][coi]
* Stateless objects where possible
